# Prob 1
I first saw it is a brute force program and decided to go with clang as it is the best for those type of programs
I did basic static typing and checked the program and it worked

# Prob 2
Almost same as the first one and i chose clang and fibonacci is very straightforward in c

# Prob 3
I wanted to try a new programming language as i already knew basic clang and it was not any new learning for me. then i remembered that there is another contender for the fastest programming language Rust... So i brushed up the basic static coding in rust.
## Bonus...
I felt rust is too slow after checking the test with the fifth problem... then i wanted to try it in c again so i did it


# Prob 4
with little remembrance from our c programming class last month, i got the answer pretty quickly

# Prob 5
I wanted to try something new, i wanted to test the faster of the two languages among c and rust and hence i wrote the same code in both... I noticed that rust uses 25 percent of my cpu (Quad Core) and so did clang... but it performed much better than rust... actually it was a pretty big difference (more than twice as fast)
