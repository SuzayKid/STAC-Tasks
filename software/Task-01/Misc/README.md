# How I Approached the Problem
I first thought of doing it using grep and all but then I realised that i am not confined to a single command and then i just thought i could copy all files which are of the required format to the respective folder so i wrote the .sh file accordingly
# Challenges faced
Forgot to make the directories before copying files
Caused error by creating an existing folder and hence added -p
# Resources/ Research done
manpage of mkdir
# What did i learn
mkdir can create parent folders as applicable and even change permissions
# Screenshots if applicable
