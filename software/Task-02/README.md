# How I Approached the problem
I didnt know about apis so i will first read about it in python3 -c 'import requests; help('requests')'
that didnt help much (it only told me about the functions) T-T..

I searched the web and ai to find some free apis i dont need to give credit card for...
And i found this:- https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
inside which i found an awesome api for INshorts news... https://github.com/cyberboysumanjay/Inshorts-News-API

the INShorts api isnt working so i went to the same github public apis and found out a jokes api which has a good filter and even gets the specific url according to our needs 'https://jokeapi.dev/'
